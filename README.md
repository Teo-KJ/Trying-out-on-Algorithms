# Trying-Out-on-Algorithms
Trying algorithms time complexity with group mates.
A group project consist of the following members:
Isaac, Sven, Kai Jie, Toby, Clarence and Dana

## Lab 2
Project is on implementing open address hashing on a available dataset of employee ids, then analyse the results on different load factor of the hash table.

Future plans:
Implement other rehashing methods for open address hashing and use of other data that are not completely in numerical data type.

## Lab 3 
Project is on comparing sorting algorithms, with regards to Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. Lab3_final.java is the file we used to identify the comparison.

Future plans:
Compare with heapsort.

## Lab 4
Project on implementing a Breadth First Search algorithm.

Future plans:
Experimenting with other algorithms on larger datasets, such as Bellmon Ford algorithm.
