# Trying-Out-on-Algorithms
Trying algorithms time complexity with group mates. A group project consist of the following members:
Isaac, Sven, Kai Jie, Toby, Clarence and Dana

## Lab 3 
Project is on comparing sorting algorithms, with regards to Merge Sort and Insertion Sort. Lab3_final.java is the file we used to identify the comparison.

Future plans:
Compare with heapsort.

## Lab 4
Project on implementing a Breadth First Search algorithm.
